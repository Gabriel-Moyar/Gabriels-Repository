        <p>Howdy y'all, my names Gabriel and im a pretty simple guy. <span>I like to play music on whatever I can pick up,</span> 
        <span>wander around the woods,</span> 
    <spand>and I generally enjoy most things nerdy*.</spand><br/><h6>*ya know, movies, table top games, theater, that sort of thing.</h6></p>
    <p>So maybe my title was a bit of a red herring. I realized as I started trying to think of interesting things about my self that I may not honestly be all that interesting. But I'm an honest guy and I'm always down for an adventure or to try something new. I dont really have much more to say on the subject so heres a list of facts about me.</p>
    <h3>The List</h3>
    <p>- I am colorblind<br/>-I have only ever broken 1 bone, it was a toe<br/>- I'm a big fan of pineapple curry<br/>- In high-school I competed in a mock male beauty contest and won<br/>- I am currently craving fried chicken</p>
<p>thats about all I have for you, thanks for joining me today! and remember: stay awesome!</p>
